Local Library is a project developed by Mozilla that serves as a simple web application for managing a library of books. It allows users to perform common tasks such as listing all books, viewing detailed information about individual books, adding new books, and updating or deleting existing books. The project demonstrates essential web development skills using technologies such as Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and the Mongoose ODM.
